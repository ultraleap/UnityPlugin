# Leap Motion Unity Modules

To download Leap Motion's latest stable modules as .unitypackages, visit [our Unity developer site][devsite]. Be sure to also check out our [documentation and API reference][um-docs]!

The UnityModules repository is designed to be opened in 2019.2. Our release packages should support 5.6.2 and up, for stable Unity releases. However, this release has been tested with Unity 2019.4 LTS and Unity 2020.2. There is a separate release that supports Unity 2018.4 LTS. If you hit an issue with version support, please submit a ticket with any details!

Since Unity Modules 4.5.0, our [releases page][releases] on this repository is the official source for distribution. This version of UnityModules fixes compilation warnings in Unity 2019 and includes some fixes for newer Unity features like the Scriptable Render Pipeline (in 2019.1 and beyond).

### Notes on SpatialTracking import errors.

* Unity 2019.4 users: If you get errors related to "SpatialTracking" upon importing the Core module, you will need to install [XR Legacy Input Helpers](http://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.legacyinputhelpers@2.1/manual/index.html).

* Unity 2020.1 users: If you get errors related to "SpatialTracking" upon importing the Core module, you will need to install the [Oculus XR package](http://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.oculus@1.4/manual/index.html).
