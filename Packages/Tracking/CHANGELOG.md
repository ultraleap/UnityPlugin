## [5.13.1] - 26/08/2022

### Announcements

In line with Unity's end of support of Unity 2019 LTS, we will no longer be actively supporting Unity 2019.

We will also be deprecating some functionality and moving core utilities into a separate package.

If you are using classes and methods that are marked as obsolete and will be moved to the new legacy package without a replacement, you may wish to use "#pragma warning disable 0618" at the start and "#pragma warning restore 0618" at the end of your method that makes use of it to suppress the warnings.

If you have any concerns about this, please contact us on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/discussions)

### Fixed
- Tracking Binding is lost when reloading scenes on Android

### Known issues 
- Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on Android build targets and in scriptable render pipelines such as URP and HDRP. 
- Demo scenes do not start at the correct height for a seated user. The XR Plugin Management System adjusts the camera height. This means the user has to adjust components in the scene to the correct height - e.g. camera height. Currently our position is to support the legacy XR system height settings. 
- Hands in Desktop scenes can appear far away from the camera 
- Interactions callback scene allows blocks to be moved without doing a grasp pose. 
- Capsule hands don't have a joint colour in HDRP 
- Hand UI can become detached from hand when hand is removed from view
- Multi-device (desktop) Scene camera position can become offset
- FOV visualization does not display after changing render pipelines

This release is a hotfix for the 5.12.0 release. It fixes the XRI package dependency issue which affects the tracking preview package,
 
### Fixed 
- XRI package dependency is resolved when using the Tracking Preview package.

### Known issues 
- Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on systems using single pass stereo with the XR plugin system - e.g. Windows Mixed Reality headsets. SteamVR headsets may also default to single pass stereo, showing the same issue. However in this case, the OpenVR settings can be changed to multipass which resolves the problem.

SteamVR headsets may also default to single pass stereo, showing the same issue. However in this case, the OpenVR settings can be changed to multipass which resolves the problem.
-	Demo scenes do not start at the correct height for a seated user. The XR Plugin Management System adjusts the camera height. This means the user has to adjust components in the scene to the correct height - e.g. camera height. Currently our position is to support the legacy XR system height settings.
-	Capsule hands appear small compared to size of 'IR hands' of user using HDRP / URP and do not line up. Using standard rendering on Unity 2019.4 LTS  hands are usually not visible (but are being tracked). When they appear they do not line up with the hands in the image.
- Outline/Ghost hands sometimes show a shader issue when upgrading to SRP (TOON shader)
- Issues with slider button movements not being possible or registering false presses in moving reference frames scene when frame is moving (inconsistent). Only affects slider buttons - normal buttons work fine.
- Possible hand offset issues on XR2 headsets using SVR plugin


## [5.0.0]
### Added
- Support for Unity HDRP and URP including materials and shaders in all examples
- Hands module shaders for outline, ghost and skeleton hands
- `Service Provider` (XR, Desktop and Screentop) prefabs
- `Image Retriever` prefab
- `HandModels` prefab
- Experimental support for Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 based headsets within `com.ultraleap.tracking.preview` package.
- MainCameraProvider.cs to get the camera on Android platforms

### Changed
- Reorganized the repository layout to adhere to [UPM Package Structure](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html). Fixes [[#1113]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1113)
  - Core, Hands and Interaction Engine modules are in their own sub-folders with Editor/Runtime folders in a `com.ultraleap.tracking` UPM package.
  - Examples for all modules are in hidden `Examples~` folders within their respective package. These can be imported as samples from the package manager window or unhidden by removing the `~` when importing from .unitypackages.
  - UIInput module has is now in a separate preview package "com.ultraleap.tracking.preview".
- The following scripts are no longer required to be put on a `Camera`. Instead, they require a reference to a `Camera`.
  - LeapXRServiceProvider
  - LeapImageRetriever
  - LeapEyeDislocator
  - EnableDepthBuffer
- Reworked how adding hands to a scene works - hands can be added easily. Any type derived from `HandModelBase` can be added directly into the scene and linked with a `LeapProvider` to begin tracking immediately.
- `Frame.Get` renamed to `Frame.GetHandWithChirality`.
- Rebranded Leap Motion Unity Modules Window


### Removed
- `HandModelManager` MonoBehaviour
- `Leap Rig` Prefab
- `Leap Hand Controller` Prefab
- The following example scenes were removed:
  - Rigged Hands (VR - Infrared Viewer)
  - Rigged Hands (VR)
- Experimental modules
  - HierarchyRecording
  - Playback
- Docs - migrated to [Ultraleap Docs][docs-website]
- Internal directory
  - AutoHeader (Moved to CI folder, no longer part of any packages)
  - Generation
  - RealtimeGraph
  - Testing
  - VRVisualizer
- Legacy directory
  - DetectionExamples
  - GraphicRenderer

### Fixed
- Missing rigged hands image (Note that docs moved to [Ultraleap Docs](https://docs.ultraleap.com/unity-api/unity-user-manual/core.html)) [[#1172]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1172)
- 'SelectionMode.OnlyUserModifiable' is obsolete [[1167]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1167)
- Initializing contact bones of XR controller [[#1085]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1085)
- enableContactBoneCollision() called unnecessarily often [[#1062]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1062)
- ClearContactTracking() doesn't clear a pooled Hashset before calling Recycle() [[#1061]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1061)
- Hand position jumps when using OVRProvider [[#1054]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1054) 
- Remove additional audio listeners in example scenes
- Clipping plane in example scenes is not set close enough, Hands models are being clipped
- Images not seen in Core examples - Capsule hands (VR - Infrared Viewer)

### Known issues
-	Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on systems using single pass stereo with the XR plugin system - e.g. Windows Mixed Reality headsets. SteamVR headsets may also default to single pass stereo, showing the same issue. However in this case, the OpenVR settings can be changed to multipass which resolves the problem.
-	Demo scenes do not start at the correct height for a seated user. The XR Plugin Management System adjusts the camera height. This means the user has to adjust components in the scene to the correct height - e.g. camera height. Currently our position is to support the legacy XR system height settings.
