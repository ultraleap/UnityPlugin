## [5.9.0] - 27/05/2022

### Announcements

In line with Unity's end of support of Unity 2019 LTS, we will no longer be actively supporting Unity 2019 following this release.

We will also start deprecating some functionality and moving core utilities into a separate package.

If you have any concerns about this, please contact us on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/discussions)
 
### Added 

- Add option to prevent initializing tracking mode for XR service provider 
- Added an option in LeapImageRetriever to hide Rigel device's debug information 
- Enable the use of multiple image retrievers in a scene that correspond to different devices 
- Better visualization for a tracking deviceâ€™s position and rotation and its FOV as gizmos 

 
### Fixed 

- Automatic Volume visualization does not work in multi device mode 
- Switching between HMD and Screentop using ChangeTrackingMode() briefly switches to Desktop 
- when rendering a passthrough image with OpenGL, the hand visualization is flipped in the undistorted view 
- Changing tracking mode on the same frame as enabling a service provider has no effect 
- Capsule Hands "Cylinder Radius" only updates after hitting play 
- LeapEyeDislocator updates distortion values whenever a new device is plugged in, even if that device is not used for retrieving an image 

### Known issues 
- Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on systems using single pass stereo with the XR plugin system - e.g. Windows Mixed Reality headsets. SteamVR headsets may also default to single pass stereo, showing the same issue. However in this case, the OpenVR settings can be changed to multipass which resolves the problem. 
- Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on Android build targets and in scriptable render pipelines such as URP and HDRP. 
- Demo scenes do not start at the correct height for a seated user. The XR Plugin Management System adjusts the camera height. This means the user has to adjust components in the scene to the correct height - e.g. camera height. Currently our position is to support the legacy XR system height settings. 
- Possible hand offset issues on XR2 headsets using SVR plugin 
- Hands in Desktop scenes can appear far away from the camera 
- Interactions callback scene allows blocks to be moved without doing a grasp pose. 
- Capsule hands don't have a joint colour in HDRP 
- Hand UI can become detached from hand when hand is removed from view
 

## [5.8.0] - 28/04/2022

### Added

### Fixed

- Unit tests break downstream package dependencies [[#1182]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1182)
- reassigned Low Poly Hand material to prefab
- An image from the image Retriever would freeze when switching devices on the relevant Service Provider

### Changed
- Policy flags are now handled on a per device basis / contain information about the device they relate to
- ActiveDevice replaced by ActiveDevices. ActiveDevice marked as obsolete
- Legacy SetPolicy/ClearPolicy/IsPolicySet methods on IController marked as obsolete. Use new methods that also take a Device

### Fixed

- Sometimes Frame objects where being constructed without a device ID, even if known
- Multiple device mode remembers device serial numbers after devices are disconnected
- Service provider in multi-device scene does not track using selected device (by serial number) unless it's been selected in the editor

## [5.5.0] - 17/03/2022

### Added
- Hand Binder Scale feature, uniformly scale the 3D model model up or down based on the ratio between the leap data and the 3D model. This will require a rebind to calculate the correct scale.
- tracking service version check for multiple device mode. Warning appears if trying to select the 'specific' multi device mode in a service version < 5.3.6

### Changed

### Removed
- x86 LeapC.dll

### Fixed
- Dynamic UI scene - blocks sometimes did not expand when undocked
-	Capsule hands appear small compared to size of 'IR hands' of user using HDRP / URP and do not line up. Using standard rendering on Unity 2019.4 LTS  hands are usually not visible (but are being tracked). When they appear they do not line up with the hands in the image.
- A check has been added to ensure a subscription to device events won't happen if the leapProvider is null.

- Dynamic UI objects throwing backwards most of the time.


## [5.4.0] 

### Added

If multiple service providers are in a scene set to use the multiple device mode, they must be set to use the same tracking optimization mode. _(Multiple Device Mode is only supported on the Ultraleap Tracking Service version 5.3.6 and above)_
- Added ability to get / set custom capsule hand colours in code

### Changed
- Updated LeapC.dll client to latest service release. Service supports multiple devices.
