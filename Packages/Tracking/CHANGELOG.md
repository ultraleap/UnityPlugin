## [5.0.1] - 2021-12-16

### Added
- Adding coloring options to the capsule hands

### Changed

### Removed

### Fixed
- Generic Hand Model rendering issue with transparency
- Updated XR2 preview documentation ('How to Build a Unity Application that Shows Tracked Hands on an XR2') to account for asset path changes, name changes to preview packages in V5.0.0 (from expermimental) and in response to internal user testing

### Known issues
-	Scenes containing the infrared viewer render incorrectly on systems using single pass stereo with the XR plugin system - e.g. Windows Mixed Reality headsets. SteamVR headsets may also default to single pass stereo, showing the same issue. However in this case, the OpenVR settings can be changed to multipass which resolves the problem.
-	Demo scenes do not start at the correct height for a seated user. The XR Plugin Management System adjusts the camera height. This means the user has to adjust components in the scene to the correct height - e.g. camera height. Currently our position is to support the legacy XR system height settings.
-	Capsule hands appear small compared to size of 'IR hands' of user using HDRP / URP and do not line up. Using standard rendering on Unity 2019.4 LTS  hands are usually not visible (but are being tracked). When they appear they do not line up with the hands in the image.
- Outline/Ghost hands sometimes show a shader issue when upgrading to SRP (TOON shader)
- Issues with slider button movements not being possible or registering false presses in moving reference frames scene when frame is moving (inconsistent). Only affects slider buttons - normal buttons work fine.
- Possible hand offset issues on XR2 headsets using SVR plugin


## [5.0.0] - 2021-12-8
### Added
- Support for Unity HDRP and URP including materials and shaders in all examples
- Hands module shaders for outline, ghost and skeleton hands
- `Service Provider` (XR, Desktop and Screentop) prefabs
- `Image Retriever` prefab
- `HandModels` prefab
- Experimental support for Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 based headsets within `com.ultraleap.tracking.preview` package.
- MainCameraProvider.cs to get the camera on Android platforms

### Changed
- Reorganized the repository layout to adhere to [UPM Package Structure](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html). Fixes [[#1113]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1113)
  - Core, Hands and Interaction Engine modules are in their own sub-folders with Editor/Runtime folders in a `com.ultraleap.tracking` UPM package.
  - Examples for all modules are in hidden `Examples~` folders within their respective package. These can be imported as samples from the package manager window or unhidden by removing the `~` when importing from .unitypackages.
  - UIInput module has is now in a separate preview package "com.ultraleap.tracking.preview".
- The following scripts are no longer required to be put on a `Camera`. Instead, they require a reference to a `Camera`.
  - LeapXRServiceProvider
  - LeapImageRetriever
  - LeapEyeDislocator
  - EnableDepthBuffer
- Reworked how adding hands to a scene works - hands can be added easily. Any type derived from `HandModelBase` can be added directly into the scene and linked with a `LeapProvider` to begin tracking immediately.
- `Frame.Get` renamed to `Frame.GetHandWithChirality`.
- Rebranded Leap Motion Unity Modules Window


### Removed
- `HandModelManager` MonoBehaviour
- `Leap Rig` Prefab
- `Leap Hand Controller` Prefab
- The following example scenes were removed:
  - Rigged Hands (VR - Infrared Viewer)
  - Rigged Hands (VR)
- Experimental modules
  - HierarchyRecording
  - Playback
- Docs - migrated to [Ultraleap Docs][docs-website]
- Internal directory
  - AutoHeader (Moved to CI folder, no longer part of any packages)
  - Generation
  - RealtimeGraph
  - Testing
  - VRVisualizer
- Legacy directory
  - DetectionExamples
  - GraphicRenderer

### Fixed
- Missing rigged hands image (Note that docs moved to [Ultraleap Docs](https://docs.ultraleap.com/unity-api/unity-user-manual/core.html)) [[#1172]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1172)
- 'SelectionMode.OnlyUserModifiable' is obsolete [[1167]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1167)
- Initializing contact bones of XR controller [[#1085]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1085)
- enableContactBoneCollision() called unnecessarily often [[#1062]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1062)
- ClearContactTracking() doesn't clear a pooled Hashset before calling Recycle() [[#1061]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1061)
- Hand position jumps when using OVRProvider [[#1054]](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin/issues/1054) 
- Remove additional audio listeners in example scenes
- Clipping plane in example scenes is not set close enough, Hands models are being clipped
- Images not seen in Core examples - Capsule hands (VR - Infrared Viewer)
