# Contributing to Unity Plugin

We welcome contributions from the community. Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request to address problems you've been having or add new functionality that others would be interested in.

## Review Threads
Help the contributor when reviewing by using emoji's to show intent with each thread:
* :eyes:  - “Please do this, I want to look at it again once done / discuss it further” - reviewer is responsible for resolving thread
* :see_no_evil: - “Please do this, I don’t need to look at it again once done” - MR submitter is responsible for resolving thread
* :shrug: - “Suggestion, I don’t mind if you do it or not” - MR submitter is responsible for resolving thread
* :+1: - “This is just a positive comment on your code, no changes needed” - MR submitter is responsible for resolving thread

Got ideas for any other emojis that would be helpful? Add them here with an MR :eyes:.
